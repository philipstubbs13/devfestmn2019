* Component
  * A generic term to describe a piece of the website UI. It can refer to a single static html element, a whole page or (more commonly) something in between...
* Component Library
  * A collection of components, organized in a meaningful manner, and often providing some way to browse and preview those components.
* Get to know your users
  * Who will be using this? Engineers? Designers? Product Owners? What would make this successful from their perspective?
* Take an inventory
  * Do you have an existing app? What's currently out there? Do this from both a code and design perspective?
* Determine the deal breakers
  * What's prevented this from being successful in the past? Framework? Versioning? Lack of interest?
* Determine a tech stack
  * What's compatible with your app(s)?
  * How is this going to limit you in the future?
  * Where are things now and where do you see it going?
  * Be prepared for this to keep changing
* Pay attention to terminology
  * What is a "component"?
  * How about a "dual scrolly"?
  * Or a "drop down"?
* Decide and commit to a component life cycle
  * How does a component get designed?
  * When is it ready for development?
  * What are the technical expectations?
  * (accessability standards, testing, documentation, linters, versioning, internationalization, seo, responsive, etc)
* Don't forget about your designers
  * What assets do they have available to them?
  * How can you help them follow standards and component limitations?
* Propose your plan and determine an owner
  * Get your team excited and committed to the idea.
  * Focus on the why:
    * who is this for? Why will it benefit them? Don't allow this to become a "nice-to-have" in your workflow. Determine an owner and let them own the project.
* Be prepared to use those soft skills
  * You'll be wearing a lot of hats.
  * Not everyone will be easy to please.
  * Listen, adapt, educate
  * Buy-in is essential to the success of the project.
* Respect the creative process
  * Remove as many roadblocks as possible while still ensuring consistency.
  * Keep adjusting
* More complex Sketch integration
